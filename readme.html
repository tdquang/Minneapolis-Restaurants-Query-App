<br>Description: Our project is a website that takes the user input and gives the result based on chosen categories. 
<br>Features: Search by keyword. Filtered by cuisine, price and neighbourhood. Sort result by rating or price of restaurants. If the keyword contains "best", gives only 10 results with highest rating.
<br>Dataset: Restaurants from factual.com. Link: https://www.factual.com/data/t/restaurants-us
<br>Feature we didn't have time to implement: Result page (we put all our information on the query page instead) and sort by number of views.
